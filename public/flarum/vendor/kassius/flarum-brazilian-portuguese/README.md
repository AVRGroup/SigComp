Complete; Flarum version 0.1.0-beta4. Portuguese (Brazil) language pack. Português (Brasil), pt-BR

## Installation:

### Using composer (recommended):

Flarum use Composer to manage its dependencies and extensions. The brazilian Portuguese language pack is available on Packagist and can be managed that way. Make sure that Composer is installed on your machine, then run the following command in the location where Flarum is installed:

`composer require kassius/flarum-brazilian-portuguese`
